About Seraph AI
seraph provides doctors and patients with personalized oncology strategies, such as common types of lung, breast, and rectal cancer. We can easily test the patient's living tumor tissue to analyze how the tumor responds to drugs, and then use this platform to deliver the drug Response profiles are combined with other genetic and molecular data. Its artificial intelligence knowledge base, D-CHIP (Dynamic Clinical Health Insights Platform), analyzes the results to create a roadmap that provides additional context.
